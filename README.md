Advent of code ( http://adventofcode.com ) is an advent calendar coding challenge.  
Every day a new coding challenge is put out, which has 2 goals.

What is here is what I have done to solve the 'puzzles'.  It is the last language I have used and have not really coded in a LONG time.

I have chosen to use Powershell, but anything can be used to get the correct answer.  Well, except cheating.

@Cyclomactic is to blame for getting me into this endevour.  It is too soon to know if I should thank him or tell him to jump off a bridge.

P.S. the .txt file in each day is that day's input file and can be ignored as you will get it when you get the day's code outline.
